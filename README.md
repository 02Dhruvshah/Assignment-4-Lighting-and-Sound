Evidence of builds:
Build 1: To check the general Lighting of the scene if the dark room shows off the torches and candles as desired, the lighting works well the environment looks good still have to work on performance and implementation of the interactable object
Build 2 
Testing Android build seeing how lighting works in the headset ![vlcsnap-2022-12-21-16h03m42s796](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/115563257/208949386-9621bc34-8c37-4d9b-926e-18e695d23377.png)

Final build everything works as intended 
Purpose of Features:
You Died (or were killed) by an unknown reason but for some reason you have not left this world and you are creeping around as a ghost to between two worlds, you have the ability to see ghosts, demons and humans as well as hear them, figure out who or what chose you for an unknown purpose 
Feature 1: Lighting
 to add realistic lighting to give a sense of darkness in a dungeon of cave where the source of light are torches candles and the moon
Feature 2: Sound
Sound to immerse the player into the setting to give a sense of something creepy going on in the back ground 
Feature 3: Animation
To animate the 3 main npcs to give a realistic vibe to the atmosphere 
The 2 guards and the demon who is praying to the devil.
Mindset:
This by far is the most fun I have had to create a scene and go all in on my visuals and create a fun  but creepy experience, this assignment made me understand the basics of lighting and sound which are key part in making any 3D world seem real and immersive, if they are bad the world looks fake but if they are good no one seems to notice, cant wait to use my knowledge that I have learned from this assignment to make more projects
